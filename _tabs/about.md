I will be graduating from Worcester Polytechnic Institute with a Bacholers and Masters of Science in Computer Science and Cybersecurity. I am particularly interested in vulnerablity research and exploit development on embedded devices and IoT. I am also looking to get into some more network research particularly on the Tor Network

I want to use this site as a way of documenting my work, explaining my lessons learned, and helping those who are stuck at the same places I was. Please feel free to reach out at any of the links below with any suggestions or opportunities. 

**Past work:**

I have done embedded research work on Android TV Boxes with Caesar Creek Software. We created a custom JTAG replay driver which was implemented on a custom PCB and resulted in complete take over of the TV Box and control through our C2 server. We also found some malware running on one of the boxes. You can check out the blog detailing our work here:
