I will be graduating from Worcester Polytechnic Institute with a Bacholers and Masters of Science in Computer Science and Cybersecurity. I am particularly interested in vulnerablity research and exploit development on embedded devices and IoT. I am also looking to get into some more network research particularly on the Tor Network

I want to use this site as a way of documenting my work, explaining my lessons learned, and helping those who are stuck at the same places I was. Please feel free to reach out at any of the links below with any suggestions or opportunities.
