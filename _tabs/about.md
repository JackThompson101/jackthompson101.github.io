I am a cybersecurity graduate student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. My interests include applied cybersecurity, data analysis, and software development, with an emphasis on building practical, real-world solutions. However I am particularly interested in offensive security. Outside of my technical work, I enjoy staying active and traveling. 

This site serves as a portfolio of my projects and interests. I am open to collaboration, research opportunities, and any questions or comments that that you have.
