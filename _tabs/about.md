I am a cybersecurity graduate student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I am particularly interested in vulnerablity reserach and exploit development in embedded devices. 

This site serves as a portfolio of my projects and interests. I am open to collaboration, research opportunities, and any questions or comments that that you have.
