# Project Intro
Hello! Welcome to my blog series detailing my project for my graduate capstone class CS 587 at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. During this series I will be doing  vulnerability research on some of the most popular and cheap security cameras available on Amazon. The main goal of the project is to develop and formalize a process that I can use to attack many types of IoT and embedded devices. Additionally, I would like to find at least one vulnerability across the selection of cameras, and then build a PoC exploit. Finally, I want to examine these cameras for any type of malicious activity installed by default, such as video data going somewhere it shouldn't, or examples of botnets like [Mirai](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/mirai-botnet/). I plan to post roughly once a week to show my progress and any findings. If you are reading and have suggestions please feel free to reach out.

# Cameras Overview
In order to get started I went to Amazon and ordered 3 cameras totaling $32.19, but it is likely that I will order more cameras as the project goes on. Each of these cameras had 1,000+ ordered per month and thousands of reviews with an average above 4-stars. Clearly people order, use and trust these cameras, and that is why I think this is such an interesting project. Customers use these cameras to secure their homes, watch their children and monitor their day to day life. If I was using one of these cameras and there was a vulnerability or the manufacturer was shipping the video feed off to somewhere malicious I would want to know.

# Hardware Teardown
Now that I have the cameras we can start looking at the hardware. In terms of external access, all 3 cameras had a microSD card port, a reset button, and power input via USB-A. We should keep the reset button in the back of our head because it might be helpful to switch the boot mode later on. The microSD could be interesting to take a look at especially if it exposes JTAG via SD card early in the boot, just like in the project I did with Caesar Creek Software in [this blog](https://cc-sw.com/set-top-box-re-6-part-series-1-of-6/). If I can I will avoid repeating that process in an attempt to learn something new.

Ripping these cameras apart was pretty straight forward, and I was able to get access to the PCB after cutting through some hot glue, removing some screws and detaching some quick connects. Somewhat unsurprisingly just based on the exterior the Vsmahome and Vimtag cameras were identical so I have only included one set of images below.

Now that we have the PCBs stripped from the externals we should go through and identify and categorize the ICs and components on each board, and then look for places where we could dump the firmware, finally triaging them by how easy they will be to do. When looking at the PCB look for any ICs that have markings especially those around the [SOP8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_outline_integrated_circuit) size and bigger. Another note here is that we should look for similarities across boards. This will make it easy for us to port firmware extraction techniques, exploits, etc.

Now that we have taken a look at all 3 boards I have some ideas on where to go next. The first attempt will be using the debug headers apparent on all of the boards. If it is easy then we should be able to drop straight into a UBOOT or equivalent shell and be on our way. If we do not find success there then we will try to do some SPI flash reads to see if we can dump the firmware. We will explore both of these options in the part of this series.

# Conclusion
Thanks for reading through my first part in my IP Camera Research series. Hopefully you were able to take away the process by which you can go from a product straight off Amazon to recognizing important pieces of the PCB and then triaging where to go next. If you have any feedback please feel free to reach out via the links on the bottom of my site.
